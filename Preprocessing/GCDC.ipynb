I received a flyer in the mail and called to get information.  The new owner came over to give me an estimate and go through a folder with a complete description of what they do. I was thrilled and hired them  to clean every other week.  The first 2 cleanings they call their detailed cleanings and talk about over promise and under deliver.  The first 2 \\\"detailed cleanings\\\" were average and nothing what they tell you they would do.  The third normal cleaning was awful!  They missed everything and I really think my 4 year old could have cleaned better than they did.  You can tell they use a duster and just dust around things and not pick up small objects to dust under (lazy!)\\n\\nOn top of it, I had given them a key and on a visit they couldn't get the door unlocked and rather than call me, they had their manager Kim drive out with her screwdriver and take the whole lock off (which ended up breaking). They left after their cleaning with no door handle or lock which anyone could have gotten in, and they didn't even tell me the door handle was off.  They did comp the cleaning but I just don't feel like they used good judgment and had horrible communication.\\n\\nWe have security cameras installed and on 1 cleaning I could hear the 2 cleaners scoping out the cameras and telling each other where they were.  SHADY!!\\n\\nBeware, they seem organized and the new owners seem nice but  I think whoever runs and hires these cleaners needs to replaced.  I definitely would not recommend them.\",\n          \"Visiting from the US, I was looking for a somewhat decent Indian dining experience for dinner in the Mississauga/Brampton area without walking to a hole in the wall place where you're served on a paper plate and given plastic utensils...and there are tons of those in the area.  It's difficult to scour for a nice place because there's tons of Indians in the area and Yelp reviews seem to dictate there's no satisfying them as they always have a gripe with a restaurant for one reason or another and there seems to be no sure bet go-to place for reliable food.  I dined at Nirvana last night and it fits the bill for a nice place where you can have dinner with friends or family.  None of the food overly impressed me, but there was nothing bad with it..I guess average is how everything can be described from the mango lassi to the naan to the main courses (ordered chicken and paneer dishes) to the dessert.  Why 4 stars instead of 3?  The decor is welcoming and seeing one of the chefs working at the tandoor oven behind a glass is a nice touch I haven't ever seen at another Indian dining establishment.  Lastly, the female servers who work there are adorably cute and always running around with smiles on their faces.  If I'm ever back in the area, I'll definitely be back here for a decent meal and friendly service.\",\n          \"I don't know how I found this place on Yelp, but I'm so glad I did because I am a bigtime Harry Potter fan. I bookmarked it and insisted that my husband and I get our coffee here during our next visit. We found ourselves there on a Saturday morning around 9:30am and it wasn't too crowded.\\n\\nI was overwhelmed by the sheer options of lattes and other warm beverages. Yelp was offering a 20% discount for checking in on iced lattes so I decided to do an iced latte to help me narrow down my choices, but it didn't help much. My husband ordered a hot coconut latte and he loved it!!! It's hard to impress this man with much but he thought his latte was excellent. We also shared the croissant breakfast sandwich and we both liked that as well.\\n\\nI loved the subtle homage this place pays to Harry Potter. It's a cool place that both kids and adults can enjoy. I wish we had a place like this closer to where we live.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"ratingA1\",\n
